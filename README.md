Business Problem Statement
Home Credit aims to expand financial inclusion by providing loans to unbanked individuals with limited or no credit history. The challenge is identifying which applicants are likely to repay their loans and which may default, ensuring that capable clients are not rejected, and loans are structured for success.
The project aims to develop a model that predicts the likelihood of loan defaults to improve lending decisions.
