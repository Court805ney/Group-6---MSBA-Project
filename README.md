# Group-6---MSBA-Project

Business Problem Statement
Home Credit aims to expand financial inclusion by providing loans to unbanked individuals with limited or no credit history. The challenge is identifying which applicants are likely to repay their loans and which may default, ensuring that capable clients are not rejected, and loans are structured for success.
The project aims to develop a model that predicts the likelihood of loan defaults from attributes of of person.

Solution
Our solution to the business problem was to use XGBoost model in order to predict best candidates that were most likely to pay back their loans for approval. By using this model we did focus on some main attributes such as age, payment histories, and demographic variables. We also proposed to have different bins of people depending on these main attributes to determine how much of a loan to offer them as well as the loan payment structue in order to help them be successful in repayments.

My Contribution
I contributed to cleaning and structuring the data in order to get it in a format to run analysis on. We also all discussed differnt machine learning algorithms to run to see which would have the best predicting power. It was also an equal group efforrt to put together the powerpoint presentation.

Value of Solution
The financial impact would be a savings of $1.36 billion with a default rate of 4.9%

Difficulties Encountered
The main difficulty encountered was that the data was imbalanced and there were noisy variables that did not initially add predictive value. Managing the data and avoiding overfitting required many iteration of different feature selection.

Learnings
Learrning from the project included hands-on experience with imbalanced classification problems and interpreting model outputs. I also learned how to effectively communicate and present a business problem statement through a presentation.
